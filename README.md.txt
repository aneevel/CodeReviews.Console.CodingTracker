# Coding Tracker Application

Console application for tracking the time that you spend coding in a session.

Follows the requirements as set out by [C# Academy](https://www.thecsharpacademy.com/project/13/coding-tracker).

# How to Use

# Features

# Challenges

- Understanding the issues with querying records from the database was difficult, particularly understanding how to parse the TimeSpan value; the sections on SqlMapper
are a bit lacking on the Dapper website, I had to really dig in order to find the relevant information for this.

# What I learned

- A deeper understanding of the intricacies involved with reading/writing to databases and how many ORMs I've used have abstracted over those intricacies in the past.

# Areas to improve

# Technologies used

- Dapper (2.1.66)
- Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration (10.0.1)
